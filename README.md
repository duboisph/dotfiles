## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and change things according to your own taste. Use at your own risk!

[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is used for installation. After cloning this repo, run `./install` to automatically set up the environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

### Customization

```ini
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = name@example.com
